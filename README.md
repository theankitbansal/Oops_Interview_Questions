Basic Oops interview questions

1. What is meant by the term OOPs?

OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined using objects. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and behaviors.

2. What is the need for OOPs?

There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: 

OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they donâ€™t know the actual implementation.
With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

3. What are some major Object Oriented Programming languages?

The programming languages that use and follow the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm or OOPs, are known as Object-Oriented Programming languages. Some of the major Object-Oriented Programming languages include:

Java
C++
Javascript
Python
PHP
And many more.

4. What are some other programming paradigms other than OOPs?

Programming paradigms refers to the method of classification of programming languages based on their features. There are mainly two types of Programming Paradigms:

Imperative Programming Paradigm
Declarative Programming Paradigm
Now, these paradigms can be further classified based:

1. Imperative Programming Paradigm: Imperative programming focuses on HOW to execute program logic and defines control flow as statements that change a program state. This can be further classified as:
a) Procedural Programming Paradigm: Procedural programming specifies the steps a program must take to reach the desired state, usually read in order from top to bottom.
b) Object-Oriented Programming or OOP: Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes programs as objects, that contain some data and have some behavior.
c) Parallel Programming: Parallel programming paradigm breaks a task into subtasks and focuses on executing them simultaneously at the same time.

2. Declarative Programming Paradigm: Declarative programming focuses on WHAT to execute and defines program logic, but not a detailed control flow. Declarative paradigm can be further classified into:
a) Logical Programming Paradigm: Logical programming paradigm is based on formal logic, which refers to a set of sentences expressing facts and rules about how to solve a problem
b) Functional Programming Paradigm: Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
c) Database Programming Paradigm: Database programming model is used to manage data and information structured as fields, records, and files.

5. What is meant by Structured Programming?

Structured Programming refers to the method of programming which consists of a completely structured control flow. Here structure refers to a block, which contains a set of rules, and has a definitive control flow, such as (if/then/else), (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.

Nearly all programming paradigms include Structured programming, including the OOPs model.

6. What are the main features of OOPs?

OOPs or Object Oriented Programming mainly comprises of the below four features, and make sure you don't miss any of these:

Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Data Abstraction

7. What are some advantages of using OOPs?

OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.
OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach.
Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs.

8. Why is OOPs so popular?
